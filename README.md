# Prime Condies: A Climber's Weather Hub

Prime Condies is a web app that allows climbers to check conditions and forecasts at climbing locations across the US. Users can select multiple locations to view conditions simultaneously; and you can customize your own preferences for conditions (temperature, humidity, and chance of precipitation).

## Under the Hood

Prime Condies is a `streamlit` app which runs on [Streamlit Community Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud). It accesses the [National Weather Service's API](https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api) to retrieve forecast data.
